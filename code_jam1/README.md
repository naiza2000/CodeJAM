I have used the scraping code which I found on PCLUB student search github. This code basically creates the data of all the iitk students in database file.
Then I have written basic.py code which has used tkinter to create a window where the user will select the required blood group . After clicking on "get value", the code will automatically create a separate data from the db file containing the list of information of the students that can donate blood. I used the same data to get the usernames and used them in the mail function which finally sends the mails to the valid students.
And it took an appreciable amount of time in storing all the data.
